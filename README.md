## :scroll: Description

This is an App for the second phase of the #AndroidDevChallenge. When clicking the button, it adds a
second to the timer. Upon reaching zero, the timer is complete and is added to the list of completed
timers.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

This is my first use of the animation APIs in Compose; to make the circular progress more smooth.
